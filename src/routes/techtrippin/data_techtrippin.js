			"While clarifying use cases is important based on customer needs and their problem statements, it's incorrect to claim that use-cases impossible on GPT-3 would also be impossible on GPT-5 or future AGI systems. Such statements can sound incredibly out of touch with the rapid advancements in AI week-on-week."

Geniuses have demonstrated its possible to create a roller coaster in Excel or Snake in HTML (with some PHP for game state). <br>What's more important are presenting good options (not outdated/trashy options from 10 years ago), scrutinizing how well each option solves problems, deciding the trade-offs needed, and then guiding business owners to make the best choices."

Singapore wasn't built on spending frivolously and decision makers would definitely not choose to do so if they knew.
