Business needs that are unthinkable on GPT-3 are already solved by Claude3 Haiku. You'll keep seeing more giant leaps in AI and when AGI comes around.",

			"No shit Sherlock, of course anything can be done. It's just lazy to say this. Geniuses have demonstrated its possible to create a roller coaster in Excel or Snake in HTML (with some PHP for game state). What's more important are presenting good options (not outdated/trashy options from 10 years ago), scrutinizing how well each option solves problems, deciding the trade-offs needed, and then guiding business owners to make the best choices."

Singapore wasn't built on spending frivolously and decision makers would definitely not choose to do so if they knew. It's a side effect of an efficient civil service where bosses can be given incomplete assessment."
