	Formally, the tech implementers are not charged with building services that meet users’ needs or
	achieve policy goals. Their job is simply to meet a predetermined list of requirements. These are
	often exceedingly specific, but nowhere in government documents will you find a requirement that
	the service actually works for the people who are supposed to use it. The systems are designed
	instead to meet the needs of the bureaucracies that create them—they are risk-mitigation
	strategies for dozens of internal stakeholders. And they often fail even at that task; trying to
	be all things to all people, they’re unable to make any reasonable tradeoffs for the sake of
	usability. Formally, the tech implementers are not charged with building services that meet users’

	Blaming software that fails gets us little in the way of fixing the problems that government
	faces. More helpful is to understand the structures and culture that created the software, because
	they determine not just how the software works but how the whole system operates.
